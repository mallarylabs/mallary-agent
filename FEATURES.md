# Mallary CLI - Feature Summary

## Complete Feature Set

Mallary CLI is the official command-line interface for Mallary.ai. Its read-only commands let developers, operators, CI jobs, and AI agents inspect jobs, analytics, settings, profiles, webhooks, and connected platforms. It also has write-capable commands for uploads, publishing, replies, webhook changes, settings updates, post deletion, TikTok URL attachment, and platform disconnection. Those capabilities do not give an AI agent permission to use them.

The CLI mirrors the public Mallary API. It does not bypass plan limits, feature gates, connected-account requirements, or platform validation rules.

## AI Agent Safety Contract

This feature list describes what the CLI can do. It is not a user request to run a state-changing command.

- Start with the minimum read-only discovery needed for the request. Prefer `mallary health`, `mallary profiles list`, `mallary platforms list`, `mallary posts list`, `mallary jobs get`, `mallary analytics list`, `mallary audience list`, `mallary settings get`, or `mallary webhooks list`.
- Treat discovery output as sensitive. Request only needed fields and redact profile IDs, account labels, post data, settings, and webhook details before sharing them.
- Run an upload, post, reply, delete, TikTok URL attachment, webhook change, settings update, or platform disconnect only when the user clearly requests that type of action.
- A clear request to publish, schedule, upload media for that post, or send a reply authorizes that action. Ask only for a material detail that is missing or ambiguous; do not ask for a second confirmation.
- Keep the action within the request, run it once, and use a read-only command to verify the result. Never use a write command as a smoke test.

For unattended CI, the owner must define the exact command, profile, destinations, payload source, and intended side effect in that workflow. Do not broaden that authorization at runtime.

### Posts with Comments and Media - FULLY SUPPORTED

Mallary supports both simple post creation and advanced payload-based publishing.

#### Posts with Comments

- You can attach follow-up comments with repeatable `--comment` flags in flag mode.
- In file mode, use `comments_under_post` in the JSON payload.
- The public API currently limits follow-up comments to 3 items.

#### Multiple Media per Post/Comment

- Mallary supports multi-media posts where the target platform allows it.
- Local file paths are uploaded automatically before the post request is sent.
- Local video thumbnail paths in `media[].thumbnail_url` are uploaded automatically before the post request is sent.
- Remote third-party media URLs are rejected by the CLI.
- Already-hosted `https://files.mallary.ai/...` URLs are allowed.

#### Multi-Platform Posting

- One `posts create` request can target multiple platforms at once.
- Use repeatable `--platform` flags in flag mode.
- Use `--post-type` in flag mode when every selected platform should use the same supported type, such as `story` for Facebook and Instagram.
- Use the `platforms` array in file mode.
- Platform-specific behavior can be customized in file mode with `platform_options`, including different post types for different destinations.
- Read-only `platforms list` output includes each destination's selectable `post_types`. Never silently replace an explicitly requested Story, Reel, Short, carousel, photo, or video with a different format.

#### Advanced Features

- Automatic local file upload before post creation
- Absolute or timezone-aware scheduling
- Idempotency keys
- Optional per-post AI auto reply flag
- Job inspection
- Post analytics and account audience fetching
- Webhook management
- Settings read/update
- Connected platform listing
- TikTok post URL attachment for inbox-style TikTok workflows

## Publishing Payload Formats (Explicit-Request Reference)

Mallary supports two main ways to create content.

This section documents payload shapes. It does not recommend that an AI agent create or publish content. During read-only discovery, do not assemble a publishing command from this section.

If the user asks only for a proposal or preview, prepare it locally and do not publish. If the user clearly asks Mallary to publish, the request authorizes the post. Resolve any missing material detail, then execute without another confirmation.

### 1. Simple Flag Payload

This shape represents a small, user-requested publishing action or preview with shared fields such as a message, platforms, media, and follow-up comments. Consult `mallary posts create --help` only after the user asks for the action or proposal. Do not publish when the user asked only for a preview.

### 2. File Payload

A local JSON file can represent an action the user explicitly asked Mallary to perform or a preview the user asked to review. Pass it to `posts create` only for an explicit publishing request.

File payloads can represent:

- `platform_options`
- a reusable payload for human review
- reviewed optional fields that do not fit the smaller flag preview

## Local Payload Preview Examples (Do Not Execute)

These JSON objects demonstrate data shape only. They are not publishing requests and must not be converted into executable commands during discovery. Use them only within a clear user request, replace every placeholder, and ask only for material details the request did not supply or delegate.

### Example 1: Message with Follow-up Comments

```json
{
  "message": "<reviewed message>",
  "platforms": ["facebook", "linkedin", "x"],
  "media": [{ "url": "<reviewed local media path>" }],
  "comments_under_post": [
    { "content": "<reviewed follow-up comment 1>" },
    { "content": "<reviewed follow-up comment 2>" }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Follow-up Array Shape

```json
{
  "message": "<reviewed thread message>",
  "platforms": ["x"],
  "media": [{ "url": "<reviewed local media path>" }],
  "comments_under_post": [
    { "content": "<reviewed thread reply 1>" },
    { "content": "<reviewed thread reply 2>" },
    { "content": "<reviewed thread reply 3>" }
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Platform Options Shape

```json
{
  "message": "<reviewed message>",
  "platforms": ["facebook", "instagram", "youtube", "pinterest"],
  "media": [{ "url": "<reviewed local media path>" }],
  "scheduled_at": "<reviewed local date and time>",
  "scheduled_timezone": "<reviewed IANA timezone>",
  "platform_options": {
    "facebook": {
      "post_type": "feed"
    },
    "instagram": {
      "post_type": "reel",
      "shareToFeed": false
    },
    "youtube": {
      "post_type": "shorts",
      "title": "<reviewed title>",
      "visibility": "public",
      "playlist_id": "<reviewed existing playlist ID>"
    },
    "pinterest": {
      "post_type": "video",
      "boardId": "<reviewed board ID>"
    }
  }
}
```

## API Structure Reference

Mallary CLI ultimately submits to the Mallary API: `POST /api/v1/post`.

  };
};
```

## AI Agent Restrictions

AI agents use read-only commands by default. Uploading, publishing, replying, deleting, attaching a TikTok URL, changing webhooks or settings, and disconnecting platforms require a clear user request.

### Default Behavior: Read Only

- stay in read-only discovery unless the user explicitly asks for a publishing action or proposal
- do not infer publishing intent from a request to inspect profiles, platforms, posts, settings, jobs, or analytics
- after a user requests only a proposal, prepare a local preview and do not upload media or submit it
- after a clear request to publish, ask only for missing material details and execute without another confirmation

### Local Preview Boundary

- an explicit request for a publishing proposal authorizes only a local, non-executable preview
- an explicit request to publish authorizes that post
- include the proposed profile, destinations, text, media paths, comments, timing, and settings in that preview
- do not select or recommend a CLI creation mode during discovery
- do not upload files, create a post, or schedule content while preparing the preview
- do not turn a clear publishing request into a preview-and-confirm loop

### Additional Restrictions

- do not suggest or run a write-capable command until the user clearly requests that type of action
- prefer `--json` output for read-only machine handling
- a user-requested preview may use local JSON, but it must not be submitted unless the user asks to publish
- treat local uploads as remote data transfer to Mallary storage/CDN infrastructure. Upload only the files included in or clearly required by the user's publishing request
- never pass third-party remote media URLs directly to the CLI
- remember that free plans do not include CLI access

## Files and Documentation

- `README.md` - authoritative usage and command reference
- `SKILL.md` - compact agent-facing reference
- `QUICK_START.md` - read-only onboarding and verification
- `PROVIDER_SETTINGS.md` - provider-settings agent safety boundary; operational fields and syntax omitted
- `SUPPORTED_FILE_TYPES.md` - read-only media format and platform-limit notes
- `llms.txt` - compact command inventory and workflow notes for automated systems

## Summary

Read-only commands can inspect jobs, posts, post analytics, audience counts, settings, webhooks, profiles, and connected platforms. The following capabilities require a clear user request before an AI agent uses them:

- upload local media to Mallary storage/CDN infrastructure
- create direct or scheduled posts
- add follow-up comments
- manage webhooks
- manage brand settings
- disconnect platforms
